# RSA-Toolbox

In this notebook, we provide step by step how to build an RSA package for encrypting and decrypting messages. 

RSA is considered asymmetric encryption, where we have public and private keys. The private keys are used to decrypt messages while public keys are used to encrypt messages. RSA was called after its inventors  (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).

You can share with others your public RSA key if it is secure enough. They can encrypt any messages for you, and you can use your private key to decrypt messages..
